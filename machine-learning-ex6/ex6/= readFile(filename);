'fclose' is a built-in function from the file libinterp/corefcn/file-io.cc

 -- Built-in Function:  fclose (FID)
 -- Built-in Function:  fclose ("all")
 -- Built-in Function: STATUS = fclose ("all")
     Close the file specified by the file descriptor FID.

     If successful, `fclose' returns 0, otherwise, it returns -1.  The
     second form of the `fclose' call closes all open files except
     `stdout', `stderr', and `stdin'.

     Programming Note: When using "all" the file descriptors associated
     with gnuplot will also be closed.  This will prevent further
     plotting with gnuplot until Octave is closed and restarted.

     See also: fopen, fflush, freport.
